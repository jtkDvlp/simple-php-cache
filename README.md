# Simple PHP Cache

This very small lib is for caching in php apps. The caching is very simple. It supports caching with php`s arrays e.g. the session array and it supports file based caching. The file based version uses the php (un)serialization algorithm, thus it supports close to all types (see php documentation) and also keep the type information.
